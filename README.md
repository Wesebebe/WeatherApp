PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This is a simple weather application that  a user can use to check the weather of their favourite city. It returns the current temperature and an icon of the current weather state.
It consists of an html file, a css file and to add interactivity, an index.js file.
I've tried to add additional funtionality where a user can click a botton to change images.
